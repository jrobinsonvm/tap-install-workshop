Open VSCode. From the Command Palette (cmd + shift + P), run **Extensions: Install from VSIX…**. Select the extension file, tanzu-vscode-extension.vsix.

When you do not already have a Java Development Kit(JDK) installed, the Java extension pack prompts you to install one. 

Accept the dialog box to install the Extension Pack for Java and the YAML Language Support by Red Hat. These are required to support debug and code snippets, respectively.

Ensure Language Support for Java is running in Standard Mode.
